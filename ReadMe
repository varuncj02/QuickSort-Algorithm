Based on the Tests conducted the pivot strategy that was generally the fastest was the one where the median of 
three elements was chosen. I believe that to be so because since there were three elements and then the average
was taken that the pivot index was mostly just towards the middle of the array so the likelihood of not having
the worst case increases


For almost sorted arrays the the three random elements median was the best as generally only a few elements
were unsorted.
